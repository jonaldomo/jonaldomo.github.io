I am glad I talked myself into setting up Jekyll.  With Jekyll I am able to write a blog 
post with vi...

### Yay
Obligatory screenshot to test image functionality.

What really motivated me is when I read that I can use a custom domain name by just creating a blank 
CNAME file.  http://www.jmoses.co is my domain in case you came from somewhere else.

Alright, back to Android.  Let me know your experiences with Jekyll on Twitter @mr_john_moses.
