This is a front end for an event management system that displayed alerts in real time for engineers to take action on.  I used ExtJS 4 as the widget framework and Grails for the backend.

#### Screens

<ul class="small-block-grid-1 large-block-grid-2">

  </li>

#### What I learned

ExtJS has a lot of really cool widgets that come designed nicely out of the box.  A proof of concept can be deveopled very quickly.  Once you start adding a lot of content the code base can become overwhelming if you do not adhere to a good folder and file structure.  This was specifically for the desktop on an intranet site, so network speed was not a problem.  However, if it were available on the internet the file size of the ExtJS library could be a potential problem.  Additionally, mobile would not be supported out of the box.
