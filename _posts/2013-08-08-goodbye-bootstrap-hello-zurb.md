### The mobile is strong with this one

I have started switching over to [Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com/) for new projects.  
I even migrated this blog over to Zurb. I love the logo of the furry monster. I know that 
Bootstrap finally released 3 and a good chunk of the internet is using it.  But I really like
change and I really like reading everything on my mobile.  Seems that Zurb Foundation is ahead
of the game and that is where I try to be.

More importantly, I added a unicorn favicon.
