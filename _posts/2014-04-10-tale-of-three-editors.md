title: The tale of three text editors - Atom, Sublime & Textmate

tags: [atom, textmate, sublime text, ide, editor]

Github has released a new text editor this past month called Atom.  I finally received an invite and it is time to put it to the test against Sublime and Textmate.

As of the date of this post I am using TextMate.  But in the past I have used Sublime Text and have recently started trying out Github's Atom.

###Overall look and feel

All three editors have a very similar look.  Can you guess which one is which?  All three editors tie based on my qualifications for overall look and feel.

|     |Atom|Sublime |Textmate|
|-----|------|---------|---------|
|folder pane|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|customizable color formatting|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|tabs|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|themes|Yes|Yes|Yes|

###Git integration

Github's Atom has the best Git integration.  I really like the coloring indications, number of line changes, and branch identification.

|     |Atom|Sublime |Textmate|
|-----|------|---------|---------|
|default git integration|Yes|No|Yes|
|display current branch|Yes|N/A|Yes|
|display file modifications|Yes|N/A|Yes|
|display # of line changes|Yes|N/A|No|

###Package management

All three have a package management system.  And oddly enough, they all kinda look the exact same too.  The shortcut is the same for both Atom and Sublime.  I give this one a tie to both Atom and Sublime.  Where is a Textmate bundle search site?

|     |Atom|Sublime |Textmate|
|-----|------|---------|---------|
|package management|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|manager shortcut key|cmd+shft+p|cmd+shft+p|none|
|centralized listing|Yes|Yes|No|

###Markdown support

I am going to give this to Textmate, because I like that you can see updates on a few tags as you type (see above screenshot).  Atom does has a Markdown preview tab, which provides more of an accurate preview.  But it does not take into account templates, which honestly would be very difficult.

|     |Atom|Sublime |Textmate|
|-----|------|---------|---------|
|color coding|No|No|Kinda|
|live preview|No|No|Kinda|
|preview panel|Yes|No|No|

###HTML, CSS, javascript support

They are all so similar that I could not make a good argument for using one over the other in this category.

###Installation and updates

Textmate can be downloaded at [http://macromates.com/download](http://macromates.com/download) and has a simple installation process.  It does have automatic updates.

Sublime can be downloaded for evaluation at [http://www.sublimetext.com](http://www.sublimetext.com).  The installation process is also simple, and also has an automatic update process.

Atom is currently invite only, but you can sign up at [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/).  The installation was also simple.  I have not received an update yet, so I can not comment on it.  Once you get an invite, you have three invites to give out.  I still have my three, leave a comment or tweet if you would like one.
