title: I made a SiliconPrairieNews.com Android App

I am addicted to reading about technology and learning what technologies 
others are having success at.  As of this writing HackerNews is where it 
is at, but they are focused on the coasts.  A few years ago if I wanted to 
read about Kansas City Startups, I would have to wade through the Kansas 
City Star or the Kansas City Business Journal.  Today that is not so much 
a problem with Silicon Prairie News (SPN) \[1\]. What is a problem is that 
there are no Android or IOS applications specific to SPN.

### SPN Today

So I am going to go ahead and change that with SPN Today, an Android application.  
I am putting the finishing touches up on it, here are a few screens below.  
In short though, I am adding a few pieces of functionality that are not 
available through the standard website:

<ul>
<li>Infinite Scrolling</li>
<li>Ability to quickly share articles with your friends</li>
</ul>

I hope you give it a shot, feel free to email me any enhancements or bugs 
you run into and I will see what I can do.
