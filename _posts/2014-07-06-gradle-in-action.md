Gradle in Action is a comprehensive guide to end-to-end project automation with Gradle.  It is published by Manning, I was asked to technically review the book.  The goal of my review was to improve the quality of the book prior to publication, by testing the content's relevance, accuracy, readability and scope of coverage.

#### What I learned

Gradle is a great tool for any developer.  The popularity of Gradle really increased when Android Studio started using Gradle as its main build tool.  As an Android developer I jumped at the chance to help with this book as I knew it would help me make the best of Gradle.
