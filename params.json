{"name":"John Moses","tagline":"what it is yo","body":"### SPN Today\r\nI am addicted to reading about technology and learning what technologies others are having success at.  As of this writing HackerNews is where it is at, but they are focused on the coasts.  A few years ago if I wanted to read about Kansas City Startups, I would have to wade through the Kansas City Star or the Kansas City Business Journal.  Today that is not so much a problem with Silicon Prairie News (SPN) [1]. What is a problem is that there is no Android or IOS application specific to SPN.\r\n\r\nSo I am going to go ahead and change that with SPN Today, an Android application.  I am putting the finishing touches up on it, here are a few screens below.  In short though, I am adding a few pieces of functionality that are not available through the standard website:\r\n\r\n* Infinite Scrolling\r\n* Ability to quickly share articles with your friends\r\n\r\nI hope you give it a shot, feel free to email me any enhancements or bugs you run into and I will see what I can do.\r\n\r\n-J\r\n\r\n[1] http://siliconprairienews.com\r\n\r\n### About Me\r\nAll day I am a husband and father of two.  Half of the day I am a Software Engineer for Cerner Corporation.  At night I am a tinkerer where I can be found with inhaling coffee and basking in the warm glow of my computer.\r\n","google":"UA-42023893-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
